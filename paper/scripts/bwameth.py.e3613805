usage: 
map bisulfite converted reads to an insilico converted genome using bwa mem.
A command to this program like:

    python bwameth.py --reference ref.fa A.fq B.fq

Gets converted to:

    bwa mem -pCMR ref.fa.bwameth.c2t '<python bwameth.py c2t A.fq B.fq'

So that A.fq has C's converted to T's and B.fq has G's converted to A's
and both are streamed directly to the aligner without a temporary file.
The output is a corrected, sorted, indexed BAM.
